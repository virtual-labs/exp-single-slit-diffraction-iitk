        "b": "Superposition principle is the basic principle used in the interference of light. When the incoming light waves superimpose constructively, the intensity increases while when they add destructively, it decreases.",

        "c": "As we know, I ∝ A2. Thus, as the two waves add constructively, their amplitude becomes twice and hence the intensity becomes four times.",
