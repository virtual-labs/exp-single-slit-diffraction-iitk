      "question": "3. What is the purpose of conducting a single-slit experiment to determine the wavelength of HeNe laser light?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To measure the intensity of the laser light",
        "b": "To create interference patterns",
        "c": "To measure the angle of incidence",
        "d": "To diffract the laser light into a spectrum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "To create interference patterns - In a single-slit experiment, the laser light passing through the narrow slit creates interference patterns, allowing for the determination of the laser's wavelength.",

      "question": "4.Which parameter primarily affects the width of the central maximum in the diffraction pattern obtained from a single slit?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The width of the slit",
        "b": "The distance to the screen",
        "c": "The wavelength of the laser light",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The width of the slit - The width of the central maximum in the diffraction pattern is primarily influenced by the width of the slit. A narrower slit results in a wider central maximum, and vice versa.",
        "b": "The width of the slit - The width of the central maximum in the diffraction pattern is primarily influenced by the width of the slit. A narrower slit results in a wider central maximum, and vice versa.",

      "question": "5.In a single-slit diffraction pattern, why do minima occur?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They are due to the complete cancellation of light waves",
        "b": "They are due to the partial absorption of light by the slit",
        "c": "They occur because of the overlapping of reflected light waves",
        "d": "They are due to the scattering of light waves at different angles"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Minima occur due to the complete destructive interference of light waves from different parts of the slit. This results in points of minimum intensity.",
