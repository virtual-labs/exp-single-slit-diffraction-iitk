#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>   
The following is an outline of the steps for determining the wavelength of He-Ne laser light using single slit diffraction:<br><br>
1. Prepare the apparatus: Set up the He-Ne laser, a single slit, and a screen to display the diffraction pattern. Ensure that the laser beam is properly aligned with the slit and that the screen is placed at a suitable distance from the slit to display a clear diffraction pattern.<br>
2. Measure the width of the slit: Use a ruler or micrometer to accurately measure the width of the slit, which will be used in the calculations. Record this value.<br>
3. Record the diffraction pattern: Turn on the He-Ne laser and observe the diffraction pattern on the screen. Take note of the positions of the first minima on either side of the central maximum. Measure the distances from the central maximum to the first minima on either side, and record these values.<br>
4. Calculate the wavelength of the laser light: Use the formula λ = d sinθ to calculate the wavelength of the laser light, where d is the width of the slit, and θ is the angle between the center line of the diffraction pattern and the position of the first minimum. To find the angle, use the relationship θ = sin^-1(y/L), where y is the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum, and L is the distance from the slit to the screen.<br>
5. Repeat the measurement and calculation process several times to increase accuracy and ensure the validity of the results.<br>
6. Determine the average value of the wavelength: Calculate the average of all the values obtained for the wavelength, which will be used as the final value for the wavelength of the He-Ne laser light.<br>
7. Compare the results to the known wavelength of He-Ne laser light: The known wavelength of He-Ne laser light is typically 632.8 nm. Compare the results of the experiment to this known value to determine the accuracy of the measurement.<br>
###### Assessment Method:  
The method of determining the wavelength of He-Ne laser light using single slit diffraction involves the following steps:<br><br>
1. Set up the experiment: Place a single slit on a flat screen and shine the He-Ne laser light through the slit towards the screen.<br>
2. Measure the width of the slit: The width of the slit should be small compared to the wavelength of the light to produce a clear diffraction pattern.<br>
3. Observe the diffraction pattern: The light passing through the slit will form a diffraction pattern on the screen, which will consist of a central bright band (the direct beam) and a series of alternating bright and dark bands on either side.<br>
4. Measure the distance between the bright bands: The distance between the bright bands is proportional to the wavelength of the light.<br>
5. Calculate the wavelength: The wavelength of the light can be calculated using the formula λ = dsinθ, where d is the distance between the slits and θ is the angle between the center of the diffraction pattern and the first bright band.<br>
6. Repeat the experiment with a different slit width: The experiment should be repeated with a different slit width to ensure that the wavelength is consistent.<br>
7. Compare the results with known values: The calculated wavelength should be compared with the known wavelength of He-Ne laser light, which is 632.8 nm.
<br><br>
By following these steps, the wavelength of He-Ne laser light can be accurately determined using single slit diffraction.    

<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
Single slit diffraction is a technique used to determine the wavelength of light by measuring the interference pattern produced when light passes through a single narrow slit. In this experiment, a He-Ne laser light source is used as the light source. The laser light is directed towards a single slit that is placed a certain distance from the laser source. The light that passes through the slit produces a diffraction pattern on a screen placed behind the slit.
<br><br>
The diffraction pattern is a series of peaks and troughs that result from the constructive and destructive interference of light waves passing through the slit. The distance between the peaks, known as the fringe spacing, is directly proportional to the wavelength of the light source. By measuring the fringe spacing and knowing the distance between the slit and the screen, the wavelength of the He-Ne laser light can be calculated using a simple formula.
<br><br>
This experiment requires precise measurements and a stable light source to produce accurate results. The measurement of the fringe spacing should be made in the center of the diffraction pattern, where the peaks and troughs are most pronounced. The results can be verified by changing the distance between the slit and screen and measuring the change in the fringe spacing. The wavelength of the He-Ne laser light determined through this experiment can be compared to the known wavelength of the laser to confirm the accuracy of the measurement.
